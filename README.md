#OVERVIEW OF THIS PROJECT:

Image Classification Model

Definition: An image classification model is a machine learning algorithm designed to categorize images into predefined classes.
How it works:
Input: The model takes an image as input.
Feature Extraction: The model extracts relevant features from the image, such as edges, shapes, textures, and colors.
Classification: Based on the extracted features, the model predicts the class or label of the image.
Building a CNN for Image Classification

1. Choose a Framework

TensorFlow: A popular open-source library developed by Google for machine learning tasks.
PyTorch: Another powerful deep learning framework known for its flexibility and ease of use.
2. Data Preparation

Dataset: Select a suitable image dataset for your classification task (e.g., CIFAR-10, ImageNet, custom dataset).
Data Loading: Load the dataset efficiently using the chosen framework's data loading utilities.
Data Preprocessing:
Resize: Resize images to a consistent size for input to the CNN.
Normalization: Normalize pixel values to a specific range (e.g., 0-1) for better model performance.
Data Augmentation: (Optional) Increase the size of the dataset by applying transformations like random cropping, flipping, and rotation.
3. CNN Architecture

Convolutional Layers: Extract features from the input image using filters.
Pooling Layers: Reduce the spatial dimensions of the feature maps while preserving important information.
Fully Connected Layers: Connect the output of the convolutional and pooling layers to a classifier (e.g., softmax) to predict the class probabilities.
